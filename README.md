# TFG-BlockChain

Blockchain technology is a cutting-edge computer technology that is highly relevant, as
it enables multiple applications, including cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and any system that
requires an independent, distributed, and secure transaction registry.

The aim of this Bachelor's thesis is to create a tool that abstracts the complexity of this
technology and allows students at the University of La Rioja to understand how it works. To
achieve this, the project has been divided into two parts: a basic learning guide and a practical
learning tool.

The basic learning guide is a concise document that aims to help students understand
the internal theory of blockchain technology. It provides a clear and simplified explanation of
basic blockchain concepts such as data structure, cryptography, blocks, and transactions. The
document aims to provide a solid theoretical knowledge base for students to understand the
functioning and key characteristics of blockchain technology. You can find this part in the link https://tinyurl.com/tfg-uni (Is in spanish)

The complementary tool (this code) is a simple application that provides students with the
opportunity to interact and visually experiment with the theoretical concepts of blockchain
technology. Through this tool, students will be able to run simulations, engage in fictitious
transactions and explore different scenarios related to blockchain.
